# Irun's "Backstory"

Told from Irun's point of view when people ask him what his family name it.
My family is from a distant land that changes hands often meaning it's hard to know what the current name is right now. They and the community there up thought that alchemy shouldn't be done and when I expressed interest in it they gave me an ultimatum either give up the idea of alchemy or I was being disowned and as you can see I chose to be disowned. For awhile I continued using it after I left that town, but issues followed me from the town with that name I believe originating from my family.
That's when I gave up on that name and never wanted to associate with that name ever again or even have it pass my lips.
I believe I will find the right family name for me in my adventures, but until then I will just be Irun.
