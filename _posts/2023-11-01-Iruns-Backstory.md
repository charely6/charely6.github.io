# Irun's Backstory


Irun Firestorm, was born to a travel group of ifrits who knowing that their kind can cause many issues living with humans and other races due to their fiery nature, and fiery selves. They have been traveling for years trading and providing services that only ifrits can truly excel at. Many towns and people that they trade with regularly know that they are all ifrits but in new areas they often wear basic disguises to hide their non-human features and those that have a harder time passing as normal humans will stay in the wagons during the trading.

Irun was trained as an alchemist from those in the alchemist wagon of their traveling group (that one in back that is always smoking) He enjoyed the idea of alchemy, the abilities of magic without having to rush throwing spells together on the fly.

After he was fully trained he was offered a position in the alchemist wagon, but he knew he wanted to take off on his own and make his own life. His family and traveling group have been hiding the fact that they are ifrits for years and he felt he should do the same.

They helped him work out his official human identity, but he didn't want to use the boring human name they arranged for him (Steven Robinson). He felt his name, Irun, could pass as a human but knew Firestorm was known for their trade and services, and had many rumors of them not being human. He thought he would come up with a new last name on the fly when he needed it (the solution of alchemists) but when the time came he realized he didn't need one.

He left the wagon group using the official story his family arranged he walked into a town that was not on their normal traveling routes and claims to have been part of a caravan that was disbanded near there due to in fighting. He used the name Steven Robinson until he got to the capital where he bribed some people to make him real paperwork for Irun, just Irun. He believed in learning and going were the wind takes him, traveling wherever he feels the next adventure will begin.
