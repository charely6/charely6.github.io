This is an attempt to combine Airmid and Apsu for a Celtic themed Pathfinder world.


This is for a Celtic campaign that has recently been started and I am playing a bard who worships Airmid seeing as he was believed to be blessed by Airmid at birth. 



My sources for details are going to be 

Apsu: pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Apsu

Airmid: orderwhitemoon.org/goddess/Airmid/airmid.html


I am planning on combineing symbols and stories that protain to both keeping most of Airmid, but adding enough of Apsu to give enough fantasy to fit properly into a pathfinder based world.
