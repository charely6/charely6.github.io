# Roxy's Backstory

Roxy was not raised in a standard Goliath society on a mountain, she was raised by a single mom in a growing metropolis. She learned that people with power are the people in control no matter how much they actually knew but she also knew the correct knowledge could lead to power.

She never really wondered who he father was, because she never felt like she was missing anything from not having one, her mother raised her to be comfortable taking on the world around her on her own. She was raised to be interested in everything and know generally how to find it.

When she was old enough she started working at the library learning to organize and find any information she needed and note it away, some of the professional library's recognized her potential as an assistant/secretary. She did that for a few years feeling that she could better. She started looking around and found a wizard who was very disorganized and looking for an assistant to help them get all their notes organize.

With the reference of the librarians the wizard took her on, and gave her access to his personal library for her to organize his personal notes and journals. She also became of age and moved into the staff quarters of his tower. She spent her days, organizing the wizards notes, and her nights learning as much as she could from the wizard's library.

She could do knowledge and organization but she couldn't wrap her head around doing magic like she had hoped when she took this job, but she found out about the occult and being granted power.
She learned all she could about the occult and which patrons had histories of being able to make safe deals with. When she had one chosen "The Fiend" she got the wizards notes organized and handed the job off to a pair of new assistants that she helped select from the library's assistances and went off on her own to make a deal.

She made copies of all the instructions she needed and wrote up her contract. She spent up much of her savings on rent for a small building in the run down part of town, and started working on the summoning. It took her longer than she had expected to get everything setup, but when it was ready she panicked and fretted over it.

She eventually had her checklist done and knew she was just putting it off, but she also knew her savings was dwindling and if she didn't do it soon she might not ever be able to afford everything she needs again.

One morning she woke up and knew today was the last day that was paid up for and she didn't have enough to get it for longer so she told herself do it today or you are never doing it. She did it, she summoned "The Fiend", they looked different they she expected but they took her contract read over it and after some expected negotiation, giving and taking (She expected that from the histories), but she didn't expect them to agree so quickly. Then, they left. The gear from the summoning was gone and knew it was time to go.

She cleaned up the building, dropped off the key and took off. There was a world out there, that she wanted to see and do, and she had the power to take it on now.
